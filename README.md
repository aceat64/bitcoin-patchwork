Bitcoin Patchwork client
========================

Notes
-----

* I have only tested this build on Ubuntu 10.04 and only with bitcoind.
* The makefile.unix has -march=native so you will either need to change this or only compile on the system you will be running the binary (or a system with a similar processor).
